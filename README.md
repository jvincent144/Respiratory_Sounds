# Respiratory_Sounds

We train an LSTM to discriminate between respiratory diseases classified in the respiratory sounds database available on Kaggle: http://www.auditory.org/mhonarc/2018/msg00007.html.

Note that it is necessary to separate the audio files from the text files. In addition, it is necessary to separate patient data into unique folders. For example, patient 101's audio is in a folder named 101, patient 102's audio is in a folder named 102, and so on.
